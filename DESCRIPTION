Description: scPagwas, a polygenic principal component-scoring method that links scRNA-seq data with large-scale GWAS summary statistics to prioritize genetics-modulated cells associated with complex diseases.scPagwas is able to prioritize disease-associated individual cells by integrating the scRNA-seq data with polygenic signals from GWAS.
